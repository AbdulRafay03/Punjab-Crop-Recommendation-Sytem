# Crop Recommendation System

## Project Overview
The Crop Recommendation System is designed to help farmers in Punjab, Pakistan, select the best crops for their specific growing area.

- **Seed Recommendation**: Based on the selected crop, the system suggests the best seeds available.
- **Data Source**: Utilizes data scraped from Ayub Agriculture Research Facility(https://aari.punjab.gov.pk/cropvarities).
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for system development.
- **Tkinter**: Python library used for developing the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Data Scraping**: Techniques to gather data from the Punjab government's official website.
